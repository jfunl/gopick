# gopick
Utility to query and project data from JSON documents

## Syntax

  gopick <query> [::<projection>] [<source>]

query::
A query used to select nodes to be output
projection::
Indicates what to output from selected nodes
source::
the input source. Either a local text file or HTTP(S) GET request. If omitted,
read from stdin



## Syntax Definition

### conditions to handle

. read JSON array of objects and select matching objects
. read JSON array of primatives and select matching items
. read JSON object and select single node
. read JSON object and select list of nodes

### syntax ideas


gopick 'party::name,ordinal' presidents.JSON
gopick '[12]::name' presidents.json
gopick '[3:10]::name,ordinal' presidents.json
gopick 'name==jackson::name,ordinal' presidents.json

*Queries*


#### slices
  [start:end] # take slice of array from _start_ to _end_
  [:end]      # take slice of array from beginning to _end_
  [start:]    # take slice of array from _start_ to end of array
  [index]     # take a single element from array at _index_
  [{predicate}] # select slice based on filter _predicate_
  
#### predicates
    {attr==value} # e.g. {name==john} selects objects that have an attribute _name_ with value _john_ (case sensitive?)
    {attr} # e.g. {name} selects objects that have an attribute _name_ regardless of value (how are null handled??)
    
##### predicate operators:
    ==   equals
    !=   not equal
    >    greater than
    <    less than
    >=   greater or equal to
    <=   less or equal to
    ~    regex
  
#### projections

  (no projection) - output full object selected
  =>*       output full object selected
  =>name*   output objects with attributes starting with _name*_
  =>name1,name2,name3  output object with only _name1_, _name2_, and _name3_
  =>mix,and*,match     mix syntax.


## TO DO

* main
** [ ] define query syntax
** [ ] main reads query and (optional) source
** [ ] main determines input source (stdin, file, url)
** [ ] query is interpolated into the thing that is used to process it and produce results
** [ ] stream data into proccessing thing to generate output (can we even stream JSON?)
** [ ] determine if processing was successful and return with success code.
